# Spotify Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an end-to-end data science project focused on analyzing data obtained from the Spotify API. The project includes data scraping, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), multiple regression analysis, and deployment using Gradio.

## Overview

The project aims to analyze data from the Spotify API to gain insights into various aspects of music popularity. It involves the following steps:

1. **Data Scraping**: Retrieve data from the Spotify API, including information about songs, artists, and genres.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Perform simple cleaning operations on the retrieved data to prepare it for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to explore trends and patterns in the data. This includes generating visualizations such as time series plots of rising and falling genres and bar charts of top artists.

4. **Multiple Regression Analysis**: Utilize multiple regression to identify the song features that contribute to its popularity.

5. **Deployment with Gradio**: Deploy the trained regression model using Gradio to create an interactive web application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: The programming language used for this project. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python package installer. It usually comes installed with Python. Ensure it's up-to-date by running `pip install --upgrade pip`.
- **Git**: Version control system used for managing the project. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd spotify-data-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Data Scraping**: Run the data scraping script to retrieve data from the Spotify API:

   ```
   python scrape_data.py
   ```

   This will fetch the required data and store it in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

2. **Data Cleaning**: Perform any necessary data cleaning operations. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the data using Jupyter Notebook or any other preferred tool. Use visualizations to understand trends and patterns in the data.

4. **Multiple Regression Analysis**: Train a regression model using the cleaned data to predict song popularity based on various features.

5. **Deployment with Gradio**: Deploy the trained model using Gradio. Follow the Gradio documentation for deployment instructions.
